the Stormy
cast and crew over the city
hammering villain tasty again
bustling streets were like deserted leaving only the sound
winds to break the silence
Asif the world itself had
sort of past
rated down by an unshakable heaviness
...
there seemed thick
there's something with an uncertainty essence of loneliness and despair
